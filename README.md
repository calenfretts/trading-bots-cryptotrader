# trading-bots-cryptotrader

A few crypto trading bots I created for cryptotrader.org in 2019. Perhaps they can be of use to someone writing a bot of their own.

1. LifeBot: A simple bot that tries to arb spreads
2. Optibot: A self-optimizing TAlib bot that looks at which of a set of TA functions would have performed best over the last X periods, then switches to it
3. Flexbot: A library bot with functions available for every available TAlib function
